**BugForge** is a hands-on bug bounty training platform that provides daily and weekly labs designed to simulate real-world web application vulnerabilities. The platform focuses on practical exploitation, helping security researchers improve their skills in identifying, exploiting, and reporting vulnerabilities in realistic environments.

In this section, I document my complete walkthroughs, methodology, payload analysis, edge cases, bypass techniques, and lessons learned from each lab.

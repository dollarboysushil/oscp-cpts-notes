# SQL Injection (SQLi)

This section contains labs related to **SQL Injection (SQLi)** vulnerabilities. These labs cover different types of SQL injection techniques including:

* Error-based SQLi
* Boolean-based blind SQLi
* Time-based blind SQLi
* Union-based SQLi
* Authentication bypass
* Filter/WAF bypass techniques

Each write-up includes:

* Vulnerability identification process
* Payload crafting strategy
* Enumeration steps
* Data extraction methodology
* Prevention and mitigation notes

The goal is to build a strong, practical understanding of SQL injection exploitation aligned with real-world bug bounty scenarios.
